# Contribution Guidelines

Thank you for considering contributing to **Torch**! We welcome all contributions, whether they’re bug fixes, new features, or improvements to the documentation. This guide will help you get started with contributing.

## How to Contribute

1. **Discuss Feature Ideas or Bug Fixes**:  
   - Before starting on a new feature or significant change, please **open an issue** to discuss your idea. This helps us ensure that your contribution aligns with the project’s goals and avoids duplicate work.

2. **Scope Your Pull Request (PR)**:  
   - Try to keep each PR focused on a single feature or fix. Smaller, well-defined PRs are easier to review and help us merge changes faster.
   - If your contribution involves multiple changes, consider splitting it into multiple PRs.

3. **Fork, Clone, and Work on Your Contribution**:  
   - We use a **fork-based contribution model** as described in [GitHub's documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/exploring-projects-on-github/contributing-to-a-project).
   - Here’s a quick overview:
     - **Fork** the Torch repository.
     - **Clone** your fork to your local machine.
     - Create a **feature branch** (e.g., `feature/add-new-feature` or `fix/bug-description`) to keep your changes organized.

4. **Testing and Quality**:  
   - Please add tests for any new features or bug fixes, if possible.
   - Make sure your code follows the project’s coding style and conventions.
   - Run the existing tests to ensure your changes don’t introduce any issues.

5. **Submit Your PR**:  
   - Once you’re ready, push your branch to your forked repository and open a **Pull Request (PR)** against the **default branch** of the Torch repository.
   - In your PR description:
     - Explain the purpose of your changes.
     - Reference any related issues (e.g., “Closes #123”).
     - Include screenshots, if applicable, to help reviewers understand your changes.
   - One of our maintainers will review your PR, provide feedback, and guide you through any additional steps.

6. **Respond to Feedback**:  
   - We may request changes or ask questions about your contribution. Please respond promptly and make any necessary updates to help us move forward with merging your PR.

## Additional Notes

- **Documentation**: Don’t hesitate to improve documentation for existing features or add documentation for new ones.
- **Help and Support**: If you need any help or clarification, please feel free to ask in your PR or open a discussion.

Thank you for helping us make Torch better for everyone! We appreciate your time and effort in contributing to our project.
